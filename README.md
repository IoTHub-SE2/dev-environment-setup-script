# dev-environment-setup-script
Provides a script that sets up the development environment for this project. Intended as a quickstart for those having to switch to a new machine for project work.
# How to use
* clone this repository locally
`git clone https://github.com/IoTHub-SE2/dev-environment-setup-script`
* change directories if desired; project will be cloned relative to your current shell's directory.
`cd my/favorite/project/directory`
* run the script!
`chmod +x environment-setup.sh`
`./environment-setup.sh`
NOTE: script will require root privileges, and therefore a user account with root capabilities.
      this should be no issue on native Linux machines, but I will look into handling this on
      Windows ASAP.
